Sono nato a Brescia l'11 Novembre 1991 fin da giovanissimo mi sono approcciato allo studio della musica, più precisamente verso i 6 anni.

Il mio primo strumento è stata la tromba, un regalo di compleanno di mio padre, 

Was born in Brescia on November 11th, 1991. He starts applying himself to the study of music at the age of six, he dedicates especially to playing the trumpet, given to him, for his birthday, by his father. He promptly begins performing concerts with Maestro Ligasacchi's city band. He afterward enhances the study of other instruments, in particular of the western concert flute, influenced by his brother Nicolò who plays the saxophone, showing a great musical attitude and a remarkable versatility concerning the approach to really different instruments. At the age of twelve he starts attending bass classes, developing a passion for its rhythmic power and funky bassline. He's fifteen years old when he applies to Luca Marenzio Conservatory of Brescia, being accepted to the double bass academic course with highest honours. He graduates at the age of twenty two. While he's attending doublebass class, he develops a great passion for electronic music and starts studying Sound design and Mixing and Mastering. He turns up collaborating with many artists, getting into new timbres, and he also begins approaching to electronic synthesizers. He is the founder of Clockbeats and Clockbeats Orchestra.
